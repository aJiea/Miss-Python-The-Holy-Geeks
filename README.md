Miss Python and the Holy Geeks
=======

When Miss Python commenced this book, she didn't really know what the book turn out to be. She just felt like that she entered into a whole new mysterious universe of... the holy geeks. She found there were various kinds of talented holy geeks who could either compose poems with codes or complain about the society between the "if-then"s.

Well it all started from her enrollment into the [Open Mind Club](https://github.com/OpenMindClub) where she opened her chapter of the journey to Python.
